## Ôªøüè† House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

This repository contains code and resources for the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle competition. The goal of the project is to predict house prices using advanced regression models.

## üè° Introduction

In this project, I participate in the Kaggle competition titled "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques", where the goal is to predict the sale price of residential homes based on various features.
The competition serves as an excellent opportunity to practice advanced machine learning regression techniques and feature engineering.

You can access the competition here: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques.

## üìä Data
The dataset consists of two main files:

train.csv: Contains the training data with house features and the corresponding sale prices.

test.csv: Contains the test data, with house features but without sale prices (targets to predict).


## Key Features:

MSSubClass: The building class.
LotArea: The size of the lot (in square feet).
OverallQual: The overall material and finish quality.
YearBuilt: The year the house was constructed.
GrLivArea: Above-ground living area in square feet.
SalePrice: The target variable in the training data (sale price of the house).


## ü§ñ Modeling Approach
The following steps outline the approach taken in this project:

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing data

Encoding categorical variables

Scaling numerical features

Feature Engineering:

Creating new features from existing ones

Selecting important features based on correlation and importance metrics

## Modeling:

Training multiple models, including:

Linear Regression

Ridge and Lasso Regression

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

Random Forest

Model Evaluation:
